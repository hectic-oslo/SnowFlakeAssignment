# ETL Process Implementation with SQL

## Overview
This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using SQL to efficiently manage data processing workflows. The SQL script provided performs the following key operations:

1. **Extract**: Fetch raw data from a source table.
2. **Transform**: Apply transformations such as filtering, aggregations, and data cleaning to prepare the data for analysis.
3. **Load**: Insert the transformed data into a target table.

## Features
- Modular SQL script with well-defined steps for each phase of the ETL process.
- Handles large datasets efficiently using optimized SQL queries.
- Ensures data integrity with validation checks and error handling mechanisms.
- Example includes operations such as filtering rows, grouping data, and performing aggregations.

## Prerequisites
- A running database instance (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, or any compatible database).
- A source table (`source_table`) containing raw data.
- A target table (`target_table`) to store transformed data.

## How to Use

1. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Ensure the database is running and accessible.
   - Create the `source_table` and `target_table` as per your schema requirements.

2. **Load Raw Data**:
   - Populate the `source_table` with your raw data for processing.

3. **Run the SQL Script**:
   - Execute the SQL script provided in this repository.
   - The script will extract data from the `source_table`, apply transformations, and load the output into the `target_table`.

4. **Verify Results**:
   - Query the `target_table` to confirm the transformed data.

## Example
### SQL Script Overview
```sql
-- Extract: Fetch data from the source table
SELECT * 
FROM source_table
WHERE condition = 'example';

-- Transform: Apply transformations
WITH transformed_data AS (
    SELECT column1, 
           column2, 
           SUM(column3) AS aggregated_value
    FROM source_table
    WHERE condition = 'example'
    GROUP BY column1, column2
)

-- Load: Insert the transformed data into the target table
INSERT INTO target_table (column1, column2, aggregated_value)
SELECT column1, column2, aggregated_value
FROM transformed_data;
```

## Customization
- Update the `condition` and column names in the SQL script to match your specific use case.
- Modify the transformations (e.g., aggregations, joins, filters) as required.
- Ensure that the target table schema aligns with the transformed data.
